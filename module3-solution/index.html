					<h3 id="pizza">Pizza</h3>
					<p>Pizza is a type of food that was created in Italy. It is made by putting "toppings" (such as cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and basil and fries) over a piece of bread covered with sauce. The sauce is most often tomato-based, but sometimes butter-based sauces are used. The piece of bread is usually called a "pizza crust". Almost any kind of topping can be put over a pizza. The toppings used are different in different parts of the world. Pizza comes from Italy, from Neapolitan cuisine, but has become popular in many parts of the world.Pizza is a type of food that was created in Italy.
